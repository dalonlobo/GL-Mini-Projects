    "## Drawbacks of twitter streaming API\n",
    "\n",
    "The major drawback of the Streaming API is that Twitter’s Steaming API provides only a sample of tweets that are occurring. The actual percentage of total tweets users receive with Twitter’s Streaming API varies heavily based on the criteria users request and the current traffic. Studies have estimated that using Twitter’s Streaming API users can expect to receive anywhere from 1% of the tweets to over 40% of tweets in near real-time. The reason that you do not receive all of the tweets from the Twitter Streaming API is simply because Twitter doesn’t have the current infrastructure to support it, and they don’t want to; hence, the Twitter Firehose.

Those tweets have a child node called \"retweeted_status\" that contains the original tweet that was retweeted embedded within it. The retweet_count value attached to that node represents, roughly, the number of times that original tweet has been retweeted as of some time near when you were streamed the tweet.\n",

If you want to find out the retweet_count you have to refetch this particular tweet some time later using the rest api then you can see the retweet_count will contain the number of retweets happened till this particular point in time. \n",
